* LED doesn't blink
* ACDB ids are missing thus audio is too low/loud
* Dual speaker support is likely to be broken (ZE601KL) --> luca020400: It should be supported ( untested )
* Decryption does not work in TWRP recovery
* SELinux is permissive
* more...

Z00E:
---
* It's not unlockable at the moment thus we can't support it

Z00L:
